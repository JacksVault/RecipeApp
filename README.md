![App Screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Overview

The Recipe Recommendation App is a cross-platform mobile application built using React Native. It allows users to enter the ingredients they have on hand, and it generates a step-by-step recipe using the Spoonacular API. The app displays the recipe title, instructions, and an image (if available).

## Features

- Enter ingredients: Users can input the ingredients they have in a comma-separated format.
- Get Recipe: After entering the ingredients, users can click the "Get Recipe" button to fetch a recipe recommendation from the Spoonacular API.
- Display Recipe: The app will display the recommended recipe's title, instructions, and an image (if available).
- Error Handling: If there are no recipes found for the provided ingredients or there is an error during the API request, appropriate error messages will be displayed to the user.

## Requirements

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- React Native development environment set up (refer to the React Native documentation for setup instructions)

   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
